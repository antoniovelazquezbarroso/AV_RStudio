## Introduction

[Life expectancy data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth) 

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth was downloaded from data.gov.

This dataset contains death rates and life-expectancy statistics
from 1900 to 2018. Exploratory analysis was conducted on this
dataset.

```{r get_data, include=FALSE}
source("process_data.R")
```

```{r summary}
summary(expectancy)
```


## Expectancy Dataset Sample
Below you will find a widget that you may use to few the
contents of the data expectancy dataset. This is the dataset
that will be explored later on in this analysis.


```{r include=FALSE}
library(DT)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(expectancy,
options = list(pageLength = 5))
```


## Life Expectancy Plot
The plot below shows life expectancy by year for all sexes.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
i_plot <-
expectancy %>%
filter(race == "All Races") %>%
ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy)) +
geom_line(aes(color = sex))
ggplotly(i_plot)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
